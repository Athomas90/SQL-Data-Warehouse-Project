# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project

This project was designed to build a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data from multiple source systems, enabling comprehensive analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making for the organization.

**This project involves**:

**Data Sources & Integration**

* Import and consolidate data from two primary source systems:
     * Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system
     * Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system
* Source data will be provided as CSV files
* Integrate both data sources into a unified, analytics-optimized data model

**Data Quality Management**

* Implement data cleansing procedures to address quality issues
* Establish validation rules to ensure data integrity
* Resolve inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values prior to analysis

**Data Model Design**

* Create a user-friendly data model optimized for analytical queries
* Design appropriate dimensional and fact tables based on business requirements
* Focus on current dataset implementation (no historical data requirements)
* Ensure the model supports efficient reporting and analysis

**Documentation Requirements**

* Develop comprehensive data model documentation including:
    * Entity relationship diagrams
    * Data dictionary with field definitions
    * Source-to-target mapping documentation
    * Business rules and transformations applied

**Project Overview**

This data warehouse project aims to solve the organization's challenge of fragmented sales data by creating a consolidated analytical platform. Currently, sales data resides in separate ERP and CRM systems, making comprehensive analysis difficult and time-consuming.
The data engineering team will build a SQL Server-based data warehouse that serves as the single source of truth for sales analytics. The solution will involve extracting data from the source systems (provided as CSV files), transforming it to address quality issues, and loading it into a dimensional model designed specifically for analytical queries.
